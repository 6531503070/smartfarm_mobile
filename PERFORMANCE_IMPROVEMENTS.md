# Performance Improvements Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Navigation Stack Buildup (CRITICAL FIX)**
**Problem:** The app was using `Navigator.push()` in the bottom navigation, causing pages to accumulate in the navigation stack instead of replacing each other.

**Solution:** 
- Created `NavigationService` class for centralized navigation management
- Replaced `Navigator.push()` with `Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil()` to clear the stack
- Added navigation guards to prevent unnecessary navigation to the same page

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/ui/component/bottom_bar.dart`
- `lib/ui/route/navigation_service.dart` (new)
- `lib/app.dart`

### 2. **Chart Performance Optimization**
**Problem:** Multiple `SfCartesianChart` widgets were being recreated on every build in the home page.

**Solution:**
- Used `useMemoized()` to cache chart data
- Added `const` constructors where possible
- Prevented unnecessary chart recreations

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/ui/route/home_page.dart`

### 3. **Asset Loading Optimization**
**Problem:** Logo image was being loaded on every build in the login page.

**Solution:**
- Memoized the logo image provider using `useMemoized()`
- Added `const` constructors for static widgets

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/ui/route/login_page.dart`

### 4. **Performance Monitoring**
**Problem:** No way to track performance issues during development.

**Solution:**
- Created `PerformanceMonitor` utility class
- Added `PerformanceTracking` mixin for automatic page tracking
- Created `DebugOverlay` component for real-time monitoring

**Files Created:**
- `lib/util/performance_monitor.dart`
- `lib/ui/component/debug_overlay.dart`

## Key Performance Improvements

### Navigation Management
```dart
// Before (caused stack buildup)
Navigator.push(context, PageTransition(...));

// After (clears stack)
NavigationService.navigateToHome();
```

### Chart Data Memoization
```dart
// Before (recreated every build)
dataSource: <SalesData>[
  SalesData('Jan', 35),
  // ...
]

// After (memoized)
final waterUsageData = useMemoized(() => <SalesData>[
  SalesData('Jan', 35),
  // ...
], []);
```

### Asset Memoization
```dart
// Before (recreated every build)
image: Assets.images.logo.provider()

// After (memoized)
final logoImage = useMemoized(() => Assets.images.logo.provider(), []);
```

## Testing the Improvements

1. **Run the app** and navigate between pages multiple times
2. **Check the debug overlay** (top-right button) to monitor:
   - Active pages count
   - Page visit statistics
   - Memory usage
3. **Look for performance logs** in the console (debug mode)

## Expected Results

- **No more lag** when switching between pages
- **Consistent performance** regardless of how many times you navigate
- **Lower memory usage** due to proper cleanup
- **Faster page transitions** due to optimized rendering

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consider using `IndexedStack`** for bottom navigation if you want to preserve page state
2. **Implement proper state management** for data that needs to persist across pages
3. **Add error boundaries** to prevent crashes from affecting performance
4. **Monitor memory usage** in production builds
5. **Consider lazy loading** for heavy components

## Debug Tools Available

- **Debug Overlay:** Toggle with the eye icon in the top-right corner
- **Console Logs:** Check for performance tracking messages
- **Memory Monitoring:** Use the debug overlay to track active pages

## Files Modified Summary

### New Files:
- `lib/ui/route/navigation_service.dart`
- `lib/util/performance_monitor.dart`
- `lib/ui/component/debug_overlay.dart`
- `PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`

### Modified Files:
- `lib/app.dart`
- `lib/ui/component/bottom_bar.dart`
- `lib/ui/route/home_page.dart`
- `lib/ui/route/login_page.dart`

The app should now perform much better with no lag when switching between pages!
